The ablation study aimed to investigate the relationship between train data and model results.
To achieve this, nine models were constructed, with each model incorporating an increasing
amount of data. The results of these models are plotted in Figure ??. The exact values are
given in ??. The positive relationship between training data and increased model performance
is clearly visible. To further visualise this relationship, a exponential formula (aeb) was fitted to
the data using regression. In that process the raw results not the displayed means where used. To receive result that are easier to interpret  an additional linear function was fittet to the points also using regression. This function is an approximation of the exponential function. Therefore the first two points were excluded, because they are outside of the near linear interval of the function. If these points remained in the data it would decrease the quality of the approximation. The function has a gradient of ... or ... per 100 images. Thus between 1000 and 2500 an approximate performance gain of ... was achieved. This increase could be lower or higher given a different set of training parameters.
